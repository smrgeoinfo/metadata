We adopt the definition from CitizenScience.org 'A Project is an organized effort carefully designed to achieve a particular goal.'(https://core.citizenscience.org/docs/project/). This implementation uses schema.org entities and properties to implement the RAID0.5 model. In order to validate with validator.schema.org, have to declare @types to include {ResearchProject, MedicalStudy, Event, Action, CreativeWork}. Can't validate multiple types with JSON schema, so root @type property in the 'about' section is not in the schema; this allows including properties relevant to projects but scoped more narrowly in schema.org domainIncludes. 'status','instrument','result', and 'authorized_by' are extensions of the RAID model. 'funding' is represented as an explicit property instead as a 'relatedObject' (relatedLink in schema.org).",
